# Signature App Server

- This is the backend API for the Signature App built using:

- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- Multer file upload

## Setup

- npm install
- npm run dev

``` sql
-Create a `.env` file with:

- PORT=5000
-MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/signatureapp
-JWT_SECRET=your_secret
```

**1\. User Authentication**

*   **JWT-based login & registration**
*   **bcrypt** is used to securely hash passwords
*   Middleware ensures protected routes can only be accessed by authenticated users  
    ðŸ”’ _Secure session management for each user_

**2\. PDF Upload & Storage**

*   Uses **Multer** to handle PDF file uploads
*   Stores file metadata in MongoDB (file name, size, upload date, user ID)
*   Uploaded PDFs are stored locally or in cloud storage

**3\. Signature Metadata API**

*   Stores signature coordinates, size, type (typed, drawn, or image), page number, and font/color if applicable
*   Allows multiple signatures per PDF, uniquely identified and editable

}

**4\. PDF Processing & Finalization**

*   Uses **pdf-lib** to embed typed text, image, or drawn signatures into the actual PDF
*   Coordinates are adjusted based on **A4 page scaling**
*   Final signed PDF is generated and streamed back to the client for download

**5\. Audit Trail (Optional Feature)**

*   Logs signature status updates (e.g., "signed", "pending", "rejected")
*   Tracks timestamps and user activity for document access
